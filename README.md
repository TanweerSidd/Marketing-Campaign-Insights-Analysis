## 💡 Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis utilizes Power BI to assess the performance, profitability, and customer response rates of an iFood marketing dataset sourced from Kaggle. By defining key metrics with DAX, the project provides a clear, dynamic view of campaign effectiveness.

### Key Outcomes:

* **Profitability Assessment:** We calculated the net **Campaign Profit** by comparing revenue against contact costs to determine the financial viability of the campaigns.
* **Performance Tracking:** The analysis visualizes the **% Success** rate against the **Target Response** benchmark, allowing for quick identification of highly effective versus underperforming campaigns.
* **Customer Insights:** Dashboards segment purchasing behavior (Store, Web, Catalog, Deals) to highlight the most profitable acquisition channels and customer segments.

## 📈 DAX Formulas Used

The following Data Analysis Expressions (**DAX**) were created to establish custom, critical metrics for the analysis:

| KPI | DAX Formula | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Purchase** | `SUM(ifood_df[No.CatalogPurchases]) + SUM(ifood_df[No.DealsPurchases]) + SUM(ifood_df[No.StorePurchases]) + SUM(ifood_df[No.WebPurchases])` | Calculates the total count of purchases made across all sales channels. |
| **Target Response** | `0.15 * SUM(ifood_df[Response])` | Sets a theoretical target based on a 15% rate of observed successful responses for benchmarking. |
| **Campaign Profit** | `SUM(ifood_df[Z_Revenue]) - SUM(ifood_df[Z_CostContact])` | Measures the net profit generated by the campaign by subtracting contact costs from total revenue. |
| **% Success** | `(SUM(ifood_df[Response])) / (SUM(ifood_df[Campaign_Overall]))` | Determines the overall campaign success rate as the percentage of successful responses against total campaign participation. |
